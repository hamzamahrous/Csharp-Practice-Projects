# C# Practice Projects Repository

This repository contains the core C# projects I built while practicing and mastering the language.  
They cover fundamentals, OOP, Collections & Generics, and advanced concepts like Delegates, Events, and Pub/Sub.

## 1. Task Tracker  
Beginner console app practicing C# basics: variables, loops, conditionals, lists, and input handling.

**Key points:**  
- Manage tasks (add, view, complete, delete)  
- Uses `List<T>`, simple classes, input validation, and menu loops

## 2. Library Management System  
OOP-based console app for managing books and users.

**Key points:**  
- Add/remove books  
- Display available books  
- Borrowing system with a library card

## 4. Delegate-Based Projects (3 Projects)

### 4.1 Student Grading System  
Uses Delegates, Func, Action, and Predicate to process student grades dynamically.

### 4.2 Temperature Sensor (Observer Pattern)

### 4.3 Temperature Sensor (Publish/Subscribe Pattern)  
Refactored version with a `Broker` for decoupled Pub/Sub communication.
